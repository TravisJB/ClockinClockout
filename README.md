# Clock-in/Clock-out
Clock-in/Clock-out is a simple Python program designed to allow people to clock-in or clock-out at a workplace, school, or pretty much anywhere.

# Requirements to run.
- A computer to run the main file off of.
- Python 3.6.2 installed.
- Dependencies (they are installed upon launch).

# Why did I make this?
This is just a little side project I am working on for one of my teachers at school, and also showing myself how much knowledge I know about programming and Python. I thought it would be interesting to make something like this as I have never done anything like this.

Another reason why I am making this is so teachers can track which students left the classroom, and what times they left or came back.

# How does this work?
When you launch the main file, it will bring up a console, this is where people can clock-in or clock-out (this will be changed to a nice comfy GUI sometime). In order to make an ID. You will need to do the command `make`, that will then prompt an interface telling you exactly what to do. It will log every user you make inside of the ids.txt file located in the folder you ran the program in. You can also identify IDs with names so you will never forget whose ID is whose.

# More info soon.
This project isn't even done yet. So give me time please!

# Can I edit this or fork this?
Of course, I use PyCharm to edit everything, so I would also suggest using PyCharm also.
